DESIGN DECISIONS

Only enabling landscape view because cannot figure out Postscript behaviour in portrait

POSTSCRIPT

file - give name of file and it saves one for you
width - default is canvas width
height - default is canvas height
pagewidth - sets width of printed page; canvas image scaled to fit
pageheight - sets height of printed page; canvas image scaled to fit
pagex - positioning point
pagey - positioning point
pageanchor - sets where page placed relative pagex and pagey ("n" | "e" | "s" | "w" | "center")
rotate - 0 is portrait; 1 is landscape
x - sets left edge of area to be printed (default is left edge of window)
y - sets the top edge of area to be printed (default is top edge of window)

'nw' puts page in bottom right quadrant (so n and w edges touching x and y scales)
pagex=100 means 'move 100 to the right along page edge' (it will create a margin)
x=100 means 'move 100 to the right along image edge' (it will chop off left part of image)
default page height (portrait) is 793
for some reason, 'nw' applied as 'sw' in portrait view and scales flip (positive pagey moves image up)
