GHOSTSCRIPT

The other GUIs use postscript too
PyQt may not use postscript but cannot sell under their license

LOG FILES

Log (*.log) files not recognised by PyCharm
Fix: Editor > TextMate Bundles; Deselect log option

OPENPYXL

Decided to work with Openpyxl instead of Pandas.
Workbook class not extensible (consensus on Stack Overflow)
Dropped class housing methods as most methods static
