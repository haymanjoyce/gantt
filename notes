GHOSTSCRIPT

The other GUIs use postscript too
PyQt may not use postscript but cannot sell under their license
So got to add Ghostscript to the install

LOG FILES

Log (*.log) files not recognised by PyCharm
Fix: Editor > TextMate Bundles; Deselect log option

OPENPYXL

Decided to work with Openpyxl instead of Pandas
Workbook class not extensible (consensus on Stack Overflow)
Dropped class housing methods as most methods static

VALIDATION ARGUMENTS

%d = type of action (1=insert, 0=delete, -1 for others)
%i = index of char string to be inserted/deleted, or -1
%P = value of the entry if the edit is allowed
%s = value of entry prior to editing
%S = the text string being inserted or deleted, if any
%v = the type of validation that is currently set
%V = the type of validation that triggered the callback (key, focusin, focusout, forced)
%W = the tk name of the widget

VECTOR GRAPHICS

Rectangle A: 0,0 20,10
Rectangle B: 0,10 20,20
A and B share line 0,10 20,10

Borders bleed
Experimented with limiting border to boundaries but did not seem to work so accepting the bleed

INTELLIGENCE V CONTROL

Choice to make less of planning tool and more of drawing tool where, for example:
 - You have Tasks with bars and text, or Bars and Text
 - You have Relationships with Source and Destination IDs, or Connections where the user has fine control over end points

I decided to go for control over intelligence:
 - First, target user is me and I want control over intelligence
 - Second, you can use Excel to do the intelligent stuff
 - Third, I can add intelligent stuff later, supplementing or replacing

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

Develop own grid interface
Changes to data dynamically update image
Develop scheduling capability of data objects
User can define header row
Multiple task and milestone sheets
